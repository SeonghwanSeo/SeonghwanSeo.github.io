I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemistry, KAIST, under the supervision of Prof. Woo Youn Kim.

My research area is AI-driven scientific discovery, with a particular focus on small molecule drugs. I have developed deep learning models in various areas of drug discovery including generative models, pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening, and property prediction. Recently, I have focused on synthesizable drug design.

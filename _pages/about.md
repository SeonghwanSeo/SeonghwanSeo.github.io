I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemistry, KAIST, under the supervision of [Prof. Woo Youn Kim](https://wooyoun.kaist.ac.kr).

My research area is AI-driven scientific discovery, with a particular focus on small molecule drugs.
I have developed deep learning models in various areas of drug discovery including generative modeling, virtual screening, property prediction, and pharmacophore modeling.

Recently, I have focused on generative modeling with Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets).
By incorporating synthesis-oriented generative modeling, I aim to replace traditional _in silico_ virtual screening and _in vitro_ high-throughput screening.

<!-- In the long term, I have interested in multimodal posterior modeling and uncertainty quantifying within chemical space, ultimately advancing drug discovery pipeline. -->
